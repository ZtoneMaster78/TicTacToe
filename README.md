Welcome to my very first repository, at least the first that I'm active with.
Anyway, in this repo contained a C++ file about a tic-tac-toe game.

So, it's simple. Players give the program the size of the board.
Then each player enters their char in the board.
If there is a 3-in-a-row, the game ends and the winner is the last player turn.
It's done.

For the future, I'm thinking about adding some features, those are:
- Can be played more than just 2 people
- Players can play on rectangle board
- Players can choose how many in-a-row to win, ex. 4-in-a-row, 5-in-a-row, etc

NOTE

This game will be displayed as a simple game, no fancy animations or others.
Idk how to :/
The minimum size of the board and value of in-a-row to win a game is 3.
